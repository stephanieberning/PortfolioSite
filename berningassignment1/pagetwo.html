		<p>It's hard to see things when you're too close.</p>
		
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Take a step back and look.</li>
			<li>Let's make a happy little mountain now.</li>
			<li>I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Have fun with it</h2>
		
		<ul type="circle"> 
			<li>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</li>
			
			<li><em><strong>You can't have light without dark.</strong></em></li>

			<li>You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. In this world, everything can be happy. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</li>

			<li>And right there you got an almighty cloud. <strong>Happy painting, God bless.</strong> Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't have anything but happy trees here. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</li>

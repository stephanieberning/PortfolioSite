			<p>They just float around the sky all day and have fun. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>
			<h2>Don't be bashful drop me a line.</h2>
			<p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>

			<h3>There is immense joy in just watching</h3>
			<p>Watching all the little creatures in nature. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>
